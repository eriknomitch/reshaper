    DALL-E is a neural network that creates images from text captions for a wide range of concepts expressible in natural language.

    Creating a quality text prompt is essential for getting quality images generated by DALL-E. Below is a list of examples of prompts that don't yield great results and a corresponding variation that produces great images.

examples:
  - input: The sun with a wizard hat and glasses on, when it is thinking about what would happen if it exploded
    output: The sun, wearing a wizard hat and sunglasses, thinking about what would happen if it exploded, digital art
